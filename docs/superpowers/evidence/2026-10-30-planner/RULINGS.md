# Rulings made while building the planner and risk-based merge (#53)

Ambiguities and plan defects found while executing
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-30-planner-and-merge.md`, each decided by the
spec (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-30-planner-and-merge-design.md`).

- Ruling: one pull request, not five. The coordinator asked for a single PR
  titled `feat: plan each task's steps, models and gates, and merge by risk`
  for Tasks 1–19, so the plan's per-phase PR openings (Tasks 8, 11, 14, 17, 19)
  become commits on one branch. Task 20 (brain-backed source) is a follow-up
  after #51 merges.
- Ruling: `!x` of an unmeasured `x` is unmeasured, not `true`. The plan's
  `merge.yaml` rule `change.dependencies_changed && !change.lockfile_only` and
  the spec's constraint "unmeasured never satisfies a rule" require it. No
  existing step gate uses `!`, so no gate changes meaning.
- Ruling: `process.revert_of_auto` is added to the ship vocabulary in Task 1,
  because Task 17 names it as a decision fact and the vocabulary is the single
  list of facts.
