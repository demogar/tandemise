/**
 * The first thing a new install shows.
 *
 * Tandemise used to seed a workspace called "My workspace" on first start, so
 * the app opened onto a project nobody had decided to make. That reads as an
 * app with settings rather than one organised around projects - and it hid the
 * fact that repositories, roles, runtimes and integrations all belong to a
 * project, because there was only ever the one.
 *
 * So creating a project is the first act. It also collects repositories here,
 * since a project of several repositories is the normal case rather than the
 * exotic one, and finding out later that more can be added is exactly the
 * discovery this screen exists to prevent.
