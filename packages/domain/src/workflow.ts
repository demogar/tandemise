/**
 * A workflow someone wrote, as opposed to one a model proposed.
 *
 * Tandemise shipped three workflow presets compiled into the binary, which is
 * fine until someone's process is not one of the three - and nobody's process
 * is. A real team's pipeline is specific: which gates, in what order, who
 * approves what, which repository each step lands in, and where a person has to
 * go and do something by hand. That belongs in a file next to the code it
 * describes, versioned with it and reviewable in a diff, not in this repository.
 *
 * The shape is deliberately the shape of a plan. A workflow compiles to exactly
 * the `MissionPlan` a planner would have produced, so it inherits the DAG, the
 * validator, the gates, the approvals and the scheduler unchanged - authoring a
 * workflow is writing a plan by hand, not teaching the engine a second language.
 *
 * What it is *not* is a place to restate the engine's rules. A gate that must
 * not be weakened, a retry limit, an isolated worktree per task: those are
 * enforced in code and stay there. A workflow says what the steps are.
