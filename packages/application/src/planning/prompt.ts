${renderConnectedApps(input.connectedApps ?? [])}${renderAlreadyDone(input.alreadyDone)}# The starting shape

The "${preset.name}" preset is a known-good plan for this kind of work. Start
from it and adapt it to THIS mission. Adaptation is expected and encouraged:

- Drop a phase that this mission genuinely does not need. A backend refactor
  with no user-visible surface does not need a design phase; say so by omitting
  it rather than creating a token task.
- Split implementation into several parallel tasks when the work is genuinely
  independent. Parallel tasks each get their own isolated worktree, so they must
  not touch the same files. If they would, keep them sequential.
- Add a task the preset lacks if this mission needs it (a data migration, a
  spike to answer an open question before committing to an approach).
- Do not add phases for the sake of looking thorough. Every task costs the user
  wall-clock time and model usage.

The preset, for reference:

${fence(JSON.stringify(presetPlan, null, 2), 'json')}

# Structural rules — a plan violating any of these is rejected outright

1. \`key\` is lowercase letters, digits and underscores, unique within the plan.
2. \`dependsOn\` references keys that exist in this plan${input.alreadyDone !== undefined && input.alreadyDone.steps.length > 0 ? ', or the keys under Already done' : ''}. The graph must be acyclic.
3. If a task lists an input artifact with \`required: true\`, some **transitive
   dependency** of that task must list that artifact in its \`expectedOutputs\`.
   Producing it elsewhere in the plan is not sufficient — it must be upstream.
4. \`roleId\` must be one of the role ids above.
5. Every artifact type must be from the list above, spelled exactly.
6. Any task that writes code must use \`executionPolicy.isolation: "worktree"\`.
7. \`completionGate\`, when present, is a boolean expression over measured facts.
   The available operators are \`&& || ! == != > >= < <=\` and parentheses.
   A gate replaces the check that the task wrote its outputs, so a gate on a
   task with outputs must include \`artifact.<Type>.exists\` for an artifact in
   its own \`expectedOutputs\` (for a release: \`artifact.ReleaseCandidate.exists
   && qa.criteria_unverified == 0\`). With no gate, every expected output must exist.
   These are the ONLY facts a gate may reference; any other name (a typo, or a
   number the daemon keeps for the whole mission) makes the plan invalid:
${plannerFacts()}
   Gate the task that writes the ProductSpec on \`criteria.uncovered_user == 0\`
   and \`criteria.unknown_covers == 0\`, QA on \`qa.criteria_failed == 0\`, and
   the release on \`qa.criteria_unverified == 0\`.
${hasTestCommand
    ? `   This repository declares a test command, so gate code-writing tasks on
   \`checks.tests == PASS\`. \`checks.tests != FAIL\` is also true when the tests
   were never run, so it would let unmeasured work through.`
    : `   This repository declares no test command, so \`checks.tests\` can only ever
   be SKIP. Use \`checks.tests != FAIL\` if you reference it at all.`}
8. \`retryPolicy.maxAttempts\` is at least 1. \`executionPolicy.maxWallTimeMs\` is
   positive; budget generously for implementation (30-45 minutes) and modestly
   for analysis (15-25 minutes).
9. Set \`approvalPolicy.onCompletion: true\` for any task whose output authorizes
   a consequential action — a release candidate always does.

# Steps that are not an agent

Most tasks are agent work. Two other kinds exist, and using an agent for either
is a mistake that costs the user time and money:

- \`"executor": "wait"\` — something outside this machine that must finish before
  the next task: CI on a pull request, a deploy. Give it \`"waitFor"\`, a shell
  command run in the repository every \`everyMs\` until it exits 0 (fails after
  \`timeoutMs\`). It holds no model and no worker slot. For CI on a pull request
  whose head branch the plan names, use
  \`gh pr checks <that-branch> --required\` (exit 0 only when every required
  check passed). Name that exact branch in the objective of the task that opens
  the pull request, so the two agree.
- \`"executor": "human"\` — a step only a person can do, or a decision only a
  person may make outside this system (approving a pull request on GitHub,
  making a design in a tool the workers cannot reach). The mission parks until
  they return; what they paste becomes the step's \`expectedOutputs\` artifact.

Never plan a person step to answer questions a worker will raise, or to make a
choice a worker's result will put to them. A worker that needs the person asks
with \`ask_human\` while it runs: the question reaches them in the app, with any
options, and the answer comes straight back to that worker. A person step that
says "read the questions in <file> and paste your answers" sends them looking
for something they cannot see, and still runs when there turned out to be
nothing to answer.

Neither kind needs a real \`roleId\`, capabilities, a gate, or isolation. Both
still take \`key\`, \`title\`, \`objective\` and \`dependsOn\`.

# Writing good objectives

Each task's \`objective\` is handed to a worker that has no memory of this
planning step. Write it as a direct instruction naming the concrete outcome, not
as a topic. "Implement the ImplementationPlan's steps 1-4 in the onboarding
components, add tests for the reduced-step flow, and run the repository checks"
is usable. "Work on onboarding" is not.
