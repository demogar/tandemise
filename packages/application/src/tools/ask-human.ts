 * it off. Every role holds `human.ask`, and it is classified `read`: a worker
 * must never need permission in order to request permission.
 *
 * The question becomes an ordinary `Approval`, so it arrives in the same inbox,
 * timeline and audit trail as everything else a person is asked. A second
 * notification surface for "questions", separate from "approvals", would be two
 * places to look and one of them would be missed.
