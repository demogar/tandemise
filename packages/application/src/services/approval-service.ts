 *
 * The awkward case is telling a "may this task start?" approval apart from a
 * "do you accept this task's output?" approval - both are `kind: 'action'` on
 * the same task. Rather than stamping a marker into the card (which would show
 * the user a meaningless row), it is derived from the record: a start approval
 * is created *before* the attempt's run row exists, a completion approval
 * after. The run log already knows; asking it keeps the approval card honest.
