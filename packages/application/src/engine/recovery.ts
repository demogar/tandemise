/**
 * Startup recovery (MVP.md §21.2, APPLICATION_DESIGN.md §Recovery).
 *
 * The daemon is a supervisor of other people's processes, so "what was running
 * when I died?" is a question it must answer before it does anything else.
 * `SchedulerService.start()` must not be reached until this has run: dispatching
 * into a world where a previous worker is still alive is how two agents end up
 * writing the same worktree.
 *
 * Migrations and the single-instance lock (steps 1 and 2 of the design) are the
 * composition root's, not this class's - they have to happen before the
 * database is even opened, which is before anything here can be constructed.
 *
 * The rule throughout is *verify before acting*. A lease is released only after
 * its holder is confirmed dead; a run is marked INTERRUPTED only after its pid
 * is confirmed gone. Guessing in the other direction restarts work that is
 * still running.
