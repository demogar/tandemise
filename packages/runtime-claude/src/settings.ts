/**
 * Profile settings that shape the child's environment.
 *
 * Profiles deliberately cannot carry arbitrary environment variables: a free
 * map is where an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` ends up, and Tandemise does not put
 * credentials in its database (MVP.md §P8). But one variable is not a secret
 * and is the difference between "this profile is a distinct worker" and "every
 * profile is the same account": `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, which selects the config,
 * credentials and settings a Claude Code install runs under.
 *
 * So it is exposed as a typed, single-purpose setting rather than as env. Two
 * profiles pointing at two config directories are two independent workers -
 * different login, different MCP servers, different settings - which is what
 * capability routing needs to be able to tell them apart.
